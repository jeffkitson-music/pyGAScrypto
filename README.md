Interoperabilty between Google Apps Script CryptoJS and Python cryptography

## About
These scripts use the AES standard with KBKDF2 key derivation. While each script can encode and decode independently, the primary function is to provide interoperability between Python and CryptoJS in Google Apps Script (GAS)

## Dependencies 
CryptoJS is required. The script can simply be cut and pasted into it's own file in the Google Apps Script IDE.
